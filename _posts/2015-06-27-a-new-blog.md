Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. What's neat, it is
written in Markdown using Emacs and built with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). All it takes to publish it is to push the git
repo. That's sweet.

This will be a blog about Emacs. It will contain concise posts about how to
improve your productivity and how to program Emacs to make it your perfect
editor.
