Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. What\'s neat, it is
written using Emacs in [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)
and published with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). `jekyll build` generates the
site, `jekyll serve` starts a test web server and watches for changes. All it
takes to publish is to push the git repo. That\'s awesome.
