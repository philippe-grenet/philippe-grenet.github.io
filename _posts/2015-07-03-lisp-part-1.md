This is the first article in a series about Lisp.

Lisp was the second programming language ever invented, right after Fortran in
the late fifties. John McCarthy, one of the founders of the discipline of
Artificial Intelligence, created it.

Lisp had its days during the first boom of AI; it even had its own
[hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine). Lisp has invented many,
if not most, of the programming paradigms used in modern languages, including
homoiconicity, first class functions, garbage collection, aspect-oriented
programming etc[^fn-smalltalk]. Many languages creators have said that Lisp was
a major source of inspiration for them (hello
[Java](http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg04045.html),
[Ruby](http://www.slideshare.net/yukihiro_matz/how-emacs-changed-my-life) and
JavaScript). Some colleague of mine once said, and I am paraphrasing, that
every programming language every invented either tries to be a better Fortran
or a degraded version of Lisp, e.g. some kind of Lisp for the masses. But don't
think that Lisp is history; modern Lisps like Clojure are state-of-the-art
programming languages. Lisp is the red pill.

Lisp is a *programmable programming language*. What does that mean? It means
that you can change the syntax of Lisp (dynamically, even) to make it what you
want. So for example if you are writing a text editor, you can turn Lisp into a
language for writing text editors. Lisp achieves that by putting data and code
at the same level: data can be used (evaluated, compiled) as code, and
vice versa. Whereas C provides naive text-substitution macros and C++ provides
brain-dead templates and template meta-programming weirdness, Lisp macros give
you full access to the power of Lisp at compilation time: basically you ask the
compiler "execute this code, and use the result as the code to be included in
the program". You will never find yourself wishing the language supported some
feature that would make your live easier; you can just add the feature yourself.

Developing in Lisp is easy: you can use a REPL (read-eval-print loop) to play
with your code as you write it. The story of the
[Deep Space 1](http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html) probe is an
interesting anecdote about how useful a REPL can be: "Debugging a program
running on a $100M piece of hardware that is 100 million miles away is an
interesting experience". Lisp can also be very fast, close to C-level
performance according to benchmarks. It has to be because it is so old (think
about the kind of hardware they had in the sixties).

### Dialects

There has been countless dialects of Lisp in history. The ones that are
relevant today are:

* *Common Lisp*: the ANSI standard, which has many implementations such as SBCL
  (Steel Bank Common Lisp, a high-performance native compiler). It includes one
  the best object-oriented languages I've ever seen: CLOS (Common Lisp Object
  System).
* *Scheme*: a Lisp with a minimalist design philosophy. It is the programming
  language used in the textbook
  [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs). Guile
  and Racket are popular implementations.
* *Clojure*: A very modern language that runs with the JVM or a JavaScript
  runtime. Clojure brings in a modern Lisp syntax, pure functions, software
  transactional memory, and many other cool things.
* *Emacs Lisp*: unfortunately the worse Lisp out there. It uses dynamic
  binding[^fn-dynamic-binding] by default, it is single-threaded, and it is
  super slow. The only good thing you can say about it is "well at least it's a
  Lisp". Finding a replacement is a hot topic today in the Emacs community.

### Getting started

The simplest way to get started with Lisp is just to fire up Emacs. Yes, ELisp
is not a good Lisp but it is enough to learn the basics.

There are two ways to interact with ELisp:

* `M-x ielm` (which stands for inferior emacs lisp mode) gives you a REPL
  similar to say `irb` or `python`. Use `C-UP` and `C-DOWN` to repeat commands
  you typed earlier.
* You can use any ELisp buffer such as the scratch buffer. `C-j` evaluates the
  lisp expression before the cursor and inserts the result where the cursor
  is. `M-C-x` evaluate the current form and prints the result in the
  mini-buffer (also in messages). You can also use functions like `M-x
  evaluate-region`.

Give it a try: head to the scratch buffer and type `"hello world"`. Then
evaluate with `M-C-x`: the mini-buffer should display the string. This works
because strings, like numbers, are objects that evaluate to themselves. If you
want a real hello world, type this and evaluate with `M-C-x`[^fn-debugger]:

{% highlight lisp %}
(print "hello world")
{% endhighlight %}

This is what Lisp calls a symbolic expression (s-expression or sexp). It calls
the function `print` passing a string as parameter (you can also use `format`
which is similar to C's `printf`). Lisp uses the Polish notation for function
calls; for example (1 + 2 + 3) * 5 is written in Lisp as `(* (+ 1 2 3) 5)`.

The mini-buffer should display the string "hello world" twice: one is the
printed text and the other is the returned value, which is also the printed
text. Every function returns a value which is normally the last form that was
evaluated. If you wanted the code above to return nil (which in ELisp means
void, false, and the empty list) you could do this:

{% highlight lisp %}
(progn
  (print "hello world")
  nil)
{% endhighlight %}

A `progn` is a bloc (list of sexp) which evaluates each form in sequence and
returns the value of the last form. It is named like that because of an other
function `prog1` which does the same thing but returns the value of the first
form. Run this code again with `M-C-x`: the mini-buffer should display the
string that was printed and the return value nil.

That's nice but our hello word should really be a function. So let's define
one:

{% highlight lisp %}
(defun hello-world ()
  "Prints hello and returns nil"
  (print "hello world")
  nil)

;; Call it:
(hello-world)
{% endhighlight %}

`defun` is followed by the name of the function, the list of arguments (the
empty list here), an optional documentation string, and the forms. The body of
a function is an implicit `progn`.

### Working with Lists

The basic data structure in Lisp is a single-linked list. The syntax of a list
is exactly the same as a sexp. For example let's declare a variable containing a
list of integers:

{% highlight lisp %}
(defvar l '(1 2 3))
{% endhighlight %}

`defvar` is followed by a variable name and a value (and an optional
documentation string). Note the quote character before the value: this is
syntactic sugar for `(quote (1 2 3))` which means "don't evaluate this". The
quote is needed because otherwise Lisp would try to call a function named "1"
with parameters 2 and 3. If you wanted to use the result of a function call as
value instead, you could use the `list` function:

{% highlight lisp %}
(defvar l (list 1 2 3))
{% endhighlight %}

Here we don't use the quote because we want the `list` form to be
evaluated. There is no need to quote the numbers because a number evaluates to
itself.

`l` is a *symbol*, which is an object in memory with a unique name. Symbols
have names, values, function definition and property lists. Our function
`hello-world` above is also a symbol; it has no value but it has a function
definition. The value of `l` is a list containing 3 cells or *cons* (for
construct), each made of 2 pointers: a pointer to the value and a pointer to
the next cell or nil.

![list](/assets/list.png)

Function `car` returns the value of the first pointer and `cdr` the value of
the second pointer (they are named like that for historical reasons[^fn-cons]):

{% highlight lisp %}
(car l)       ; => 1
(cdr l)       ; => (2 3)
(car (cdr l)) ; => 2
(cadr l)      ; => same as above, it's a shorcut
(cddr l)      ; => (3)
(caddr l)     ; => 3
(cdddr l)     ; nil
{% endhighlight %}

Of course Lisp has plenty of functions to manipulate lists. Here is how to
reverse our list:

{% highlight lisp %}
(setq l (reverse l)) ; => (3 2 1)
{% endhighlight %}

`setq` sets a variable to a new value (set equal).

That's it for today. Lots more to come. Stay tuned!

[^fn-smalltalk]: And almost OOP. Alan Kay, who invented Smalltalk and coined Object Oriented Programming, said that Lisp is The greatest single programming language ever designed.

[^fn-dynamic-binding]: As opposed to lexical binding. If you define a local variable x in function foo and then call function bar, bar will see the value of x even if you don't pass it as parameter.

[^fn-debugger]: If you make a mistake and end up in the debugger, just press q to exit.

[^fn-cons]: CAR and CDR were the name of 2 registers in the CPU of the IBM 701!
